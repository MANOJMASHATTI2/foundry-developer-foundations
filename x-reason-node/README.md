# WiP: Foundry Developer Foundations
### IMPORTANT: This project is under an active migration from Functions V1 to Compute modules
As part of this migration we are implementing the FDF pattern for developers to allow devs without a Foundry stack to participate. The code can also run outside of Foundry as a Docker container once the migration is complete.

This means as of today do not use this code. If you are interested in becoming a contributor contact us.
